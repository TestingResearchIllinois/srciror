To build the mutator, one needs to have a source of LLVM and a build of it locally.
The top of the Makefile assumes that these exist under ../tools/llvm and ../tools/llvm-build.
We have included a script for convenience to download the LLVM sources for version 3.8.1 and
build it.

** If one wants to use an LLVM in a different location, change the paths to LLVM at the beginning
of the Makefile
